# spacepotatoes-tank
____

This repo was created to share with what we've came up designing our tank.
- To avoid adding unnessesary files to the repo use `.gitignore` file

- At this moment there are two directories.
    - cad design
    - software

- to merge your branch into main make a request.

As I'm too lazy to clean up this repo, just open ```cad design/tank sketch v4.a3d``` if you're using Kompas 3D, or ```cad design/tank sketch v4.step``` in case you're using another CAD software.
